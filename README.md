COVID-19 case count tracker written using LitElement.

# A very short history

This is a redesigned spin-off of once was the practice app for my current employer. It was part of the initial tasks given.

If you'll check the [initial commits](https://github.com/jjdcabasolo/covid-19-tracker-app/commit/f7705c4e68920899f2f0752c74a8840fe7756c12), there are a lot of initial files. The from-scratch commits can be found on a private repo.

I asked permission to my boss if I can get that app and use it on my personal portfolio. And it was granted. Yay ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

[This is the original app](http://app-tracker-jourish.herokuapp.com/), the ones I used on our final presentation.
